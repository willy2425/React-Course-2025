1. Where does React put all of the elements I create in JSX when I 
   call `root.render()`?



2. What would show up in my console if I were to run this line of code:
```
console.log(<h1>Hello world!</h1>)
```


3. What's wrong with this code:
```
root.render(
    <h1>Hi there</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?


5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?
